## Future Enhancements

Currently, the user who creates a prediction is responsible for resolving it. In the future, we plan to introduce **AI Agents** that will:

1. Fetch trending topics and live data from platforms like Twitter.
2. Create predictions based on real-time results and popular discussions.
3. Automate the resolution process using decentralized data sources and AI insights.

This will significantly enhance user experience and reduce dependency on manual resolution.
